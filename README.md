💳 Banking Management System (C++)

A console-based Banking Management System written in C++ that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It supports multiple account types, real-time interest calculation using multithreading, and an interactive menu-driven interface for user-friendly navigation.

🚀 Features

✅ Object-Oriented Design

Uses classes and objects to model real-world banking operations.

Demonstrates inheritance to manage different account types (e.g., Savings, Current).

Applies polymorphism for handling account operations dynamically.


✅ Multiple Account Types

Savings Account with interest calculation.

Current Account with overdraft facility.

Base Account class with common attributes (name, account number, balance).


✅ Real-Time Interest Calculation

Uses C++ multithreading to calculate and apply interest periodically in the background.


✅ Menu-Driven Console UI

Create, view, deposit, withdraw, and close accounts.

Clear and easy-to-navigate console menu.


✅ Error Handling

Input validation for secure and reliable transactions.

Handles exceptions such as insufficient balance.

🏗️ Concepts Used

Classes & Objects (Encapsulation of data and behavior)

Inheritance (Base Account → SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount)

Polymorphism (Virtual functions for dynamic behavior)

Multithreading (std::thread for background tasks)

File I/O (Optional: Save account details to file for persistence)
